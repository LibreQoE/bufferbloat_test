# LibreQoS Bufferbloat Test

A comprehensive web-based tool for measuring bufferbloat and network performance under realistic load conditions. This project provides both traditional single-user testing and advanced virtual household simulation to evaluate network behavior under real-world usage scenarios.

## üöÄ What is Bufferbloat?

Bufferbloat occurs when excessive buffering in network equipment causes high latency and poor performance for real-time applications like gaming, video calls, and VoIP. Our test measures how your network connection performs under load, with a focus on latency increases that occur during high bandwidth utilization.

## Overview

The LibreQoS Bufferbloat Test offers two distinct testing modes designed to provide comprehensive network analysis. The system uses a **Simple Multiprocess Architecture** with process isolation for optimal performance and stability.

## Test Modes

### üßë Single User Test Mode
Traditional bufferbloat testing that measures individual connection performance through sequential load phases:

- **Baseline Phase (0-5s)**: Measures unloaded latency baseline
- **Download Warmup (5-10s)**: Gradual ramp-up to target download speed
- **Download Saturation (10-20s)**: Full download load with latency monitoring
- **Upload Warmup (20-25s)**: Gradual ramp-up to target upload speed  
- **Upload Saturation (25-35s)**: Full upload load with latency monitoring
- **Bidirectional Phase (35-40s)**: Simultaneous download and upload load

### üè† Virtual Household Mode
Advanced simulation that recreates a realistic household environment with multiple concurrent users and applications using **authentic traffic patterns** and **process isolation**:

#### Virtual Users (Process Isolated):
- **Alex (Competitive Gaming)** üéÆ - *Process :8002*
  - Counter-Strike 2 gameplay simulation
  - **Traffic**: 1.5 Mbps ‚Üì / 0.75 Mbps ‚Üë (constant, low-latency)
  - Real-time gaming with latency sensitivity
  
- **Sarah (Video Conference)** üë©‚Äçüíª - *Process :8003*
  - Microsoft Teams video call simulation
  - **Traffic**: 2.5 Mbps ‚Üì / 2.5 Mbps ‚Üë (constant, bidirectional)
  - HD video conferencing with consistent streams
  
- **Jake (HD Netflix Streaming)** üì∫ - *Process :8001*

| < 5 ms           | A+    | Excellent - Virtually no bufferbloat |
| 5-30 ms          | A     | Very Good - Minimal bufferbloat |
| 30-60 ms         | B     | Good - Moderate bufferbloat |
| 60-200 ms        | C     | Fair - Noticeable bufferbloat |
| 200-400 ms       | D     | Poor - Significant bufferbloat |
| ‚â• 400 ms         | F     | Very Poor - Severe bufferbloat |

**Virtual Household Mode** provides additional grading for:

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Server**: Ubuntu Server 22.04 or 24.04 (or any Linux distribution)
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Network**: Sufficient bandwidth for testing (recommended: 100+ Mbps)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/
   git clone https://github.com/LibreQoE/bufferbloat_test.git libreqos_test
   cd /opt/libreqos_test
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r server/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   python3 server/main.py
   ```
   
   The server runs on port 80 by default with a dedicated ping server on port 8085.

4. **Access the Test**:
   ```
   http://your-server-ip/
   ```

### Production Deployment

#### Systemd Service Installation
For production environments, install as a systemd service:

```bash
sudo ./install_service.sh
```

This provides:
- **Automatic startup** on system boot
- **Automatic restart** on failure
- **System journal logging**
- **Process management** via systemctl

#### Native HTTPS Setup
Set up secure access with SSL certificates (no reverse proxy needed):

```bash
# Production setup with Let's Encrypt
sudo ./setup_ssl_certificates.sh yourdomain.example.com

# Start with HTTPS and HTTP/2 support
python3 server/main.py \
  --port 443 \
  --ssl-keyfile /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem \
  --ssl-certfile /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem \
  --http2 \
  --production
```

Or for quick testing with self-signed certificates:
```bash
sudo ./create_test_certificates.sh
sudo ./start_https.sh
```

Benefits:
- **Native SSL/TLS encryption** without proxy overhead
- **HTTP/2 support** for improved performance
- **Direct process connections** maintain optimal performance
- **Enhanced security** for production deployments

### Docker Deployment

For containerized deployment, Docker support is available:

#### Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Build and run with docker-compose (serves on port 80)
docker-compose up -d

# Or build manually with custom port mapping
docker build -t libreqos-bufferbloat .
docker run -p 80:8000 -p 8001-8004:8001-8004 -p 8085:8085 libreqos-bufferbloat
```

#### Docker Configuration

The Docker setup includes:
- **Multi-process support**: All processes run within a single container
- **Port exposure**: Ports 8000-8004, 8085, and optionally 443
- **SSL support**: Mount certificates via volumes
- **Development mode**: Optional source code mounting for live updates

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml example with SSL
services:
  libreqos-bufferbloat:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
      - "8001-8004:8001-8004"
      - "8085:8085"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./ssl:/app/ssl:ro
```

### Configuration Options

```

#### Performance Tuning
Optimize for high-bandwidth connections:

```bash
# Kernel parameters for high concurrency
echo 'net.core.somaxconn = 65535' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo 'net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 65535' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo 'fs.file-max = 1000000' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sysctl -p
```
