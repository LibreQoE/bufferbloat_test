# Realistic Traffic Pattern Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines simple and effective improvements to the LibreQoS bufferbloat testing system to implement more realistic traffic patterns that improve test accuracy and avoid CAKE QoS misclassification.

## Current Issues

### Gaming Traffic (`workerGamer.js`)
- **Current**: 8ms intervals with 1KB packets
- **Problem**: Too frequent, packets too large for realistic gaming
- **CAKE Impact**: Large packets may be classified as bulk traffic

### Video Call Traffic (`workerZoom.js`)
- **Current**: 3.2ms intervals with 1.4KB packets  
- **Problem**: Too frequent for video frames, packet size not optimal
- **CAKE Impact**: Irregular timing may confuse QoS classification

### General Issues
- Traffic may not be truly bidirectional
- Potential packet batching/chunking
- Timing patterns don't match real applications

## Target Requirements

### Gaming Traffic
- **Interval**: 25ms (40 packets/second)
- **Packet Size**: <128 bytes (64-128 bytes randomized, avg 96 bytes)
- **Bidirectional**: 30% upload (commands), 70% download (game state)
- **Pattern**: Consistent timing, small packets
- **Expected Throughput**:
  - Upload: 40 pps × 96 bytes × 8 bits × 0.3 = ~0.092 Mbps
  - Download: 40 pps × 96 bytes × 8 bits × 0.7 = ~0.215 Mbps
  - **Total: ~0.31 Mbps** (much more realistic for gaming)

### Video Call Traffic
- **Interval**: 20ms (50 frames/second)
- **Packet Size**: 800-1000 bytes (realistic video frames, avg 900 bytes)
- **Bidirectional**: 50% upload, 50% download (symmetric)
- **Pattern**: Consistent frame timing, realistic video encoding sizes
- **Expected Throughput**:
  - Upload: 50 pps × 900 bytes × 8 bits × 0.5 = ~1.8 Mbps
  - Download: 50 pps × 900 bytes × 8 bits × 0.5 = ~1.8 Mbps
  - **Total: ~3.6 Mbps** (realistic for HD video calls)

### Anti-Chunking Requirements
- Individual packet transmission (no batching)
- Avoid synchronized bursts across users
- Prevent CAKE from classifying as bulk traffic

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Update Gaming Worker
**File**: `client/virtualHousehold/workers/workerGamer.js`

**Changes**:
1. Change `sendInterval` from 8ms to 25ms
2. Reduce `packetSize` from 1000 to 64-128 bytes (randomized)
3. Implement separate upload/download packet generation
4. Add timing jitter (±2ms) to prevent synchronization

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Current
sendInterval: 8, // Send every 8ms for 125 packets/sec = 1Mbps
packetSize: 1000, // 1KB packets

// New
sendInterval: 25, // Send every 25ms for 40 packets/sec (realistic gaming)
packetSize: () => 64 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 64), // 64-128 bytes randomized
```

### Phase 2: Update Video Call Worker
**File**: `client/virtualHousehold/workers/workerZoom.js`

**Changes**:
1. Change `sendInterval` from 3.2ms to 20ms
2. Adjust `packetSize` to 800-1000 bytes with variation
3. Maintain bidirectional symmetric flow
4. Add frame type simulation (I/P frames)

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Current
sendInterval: 3.2, // Send every 3.2ms for ~312 packets/sec = 3.5Mbps
packetSize: 1400, // 1.4KB packets

// New
sendInterval: 20, // Send every 20ms for 50 frames/sec (realistic video)
packetSize: () => 800 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 200), // 800-1000 bytes
```

### Phase 3: Add Anti-Chunking Logic
**File**: `client/virtualHousehold/trafficManager.js` (new)

**Features**:
1. Packet transmission validator
2. Burst prevention logic
3. Individual packet scheduling
4. Timing consistency checker

**Implementation**:
```javascript
class AntiChunkingManager {
    validatePacketSize(size, userType) {
        if (userType === 'gaming' && size > 128) return false;
        if (userType === 'video' && (size < 800 || size > 1000)) return false;
        return true;
    }
    
    scheduleIndividualTransmission(packet, delay = 0) {
        setTimeout(() => {
            this.transmitSinglePacket(packet);
        }, delay);
    }
}
```

### Phase 4: Enhanced Bidirectional Flow
**Files**: Both worker files

**Gaming Flow**:
- Upload packets: 30% of traffic (game commands, input)
- Download packets: 70% of traffic (game state, updates)
- Separate timing for each direction

**Video Flow**:
- Upload packets: 50% of traffic (local video/audio stream)
- Download packets: 50% of traffic (remote video/audio stream)
- Symmetric timing and packet sizes

### Phase 5: Update Frontend Configuration
**File**: `client/virtualHousehold/virtualHousehold.js`

**Update User Configurations**:
```javascript
// Current Alex (Gaming) configuration
alex: {
    targetDownload: 1.5,  // Mbps - OLD unrealistic value
    targetUpload: 0.75,   // Mbps - OLD unrealistic value
}

// New Alex (Gaming) configuration
alex: {
    targetDownload: 0.215, // Mbps - realistic gaming download
    targetUpload: 0.092,   // Mbps - realistic gaming upload
}

// Current Sarah (Video Call) configuration
sarah: {
    targetDownload: 2.5,  // Mbps - OLD value
    targetUpload: 2.5,    // Mbps - OLD value
}

// New Sarah (Video Call) configuration
sarah: {
    targetDownload: 1.8,  // Mbps - realistic HD video download
    targetUpload: 1.8,    // Mbps - realistic HD video upload
}
```

### Phase 6: Integration and Testing
**Files**: `client/virtualHousehold/virtualHousehold.js`

**Changes**:
1. Update user configurations with calculated throughput values
2. Add validation for realistic traffic patterns
3. Maintain compatibility with existing metrics
4. Add monitoring for CAKE classification effectiveness
