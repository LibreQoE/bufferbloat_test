## Testing Modes

### Single User Test Mode

Traditional bufferbloat testing with sequential load phases:

1. **Baseline Phase (0-5s)**: Measures unloaded latency baseline
2. **Download Warmup (5-10s)**: Gradual ramp-up to target download speed
3. **Download Saturation (10-20s)**: Full download load with latency monitoring
4. **Upload Warmup (20-25s)**: Gradual ramp-up to target upload speed
5. **Upload Saturation (25-35s)**: Full upload load with latency monitoring
6. **Bidirectional Phase (35-40s)**: Simultaneous download and upload load

### Virtual Household Mode

Advanced simulation recreating realistic household environment with multiple concurrent users:

#### Virtual User Profiles

| User | Activity | Download | Upload | Pattern | Description |
|------|----------|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Alex** | Gaming | 1.5 Mbps | 0.75 Mbps | Constant | Counter-Strike 2 gameplay simulation |
| **Sarah** | Video Conference | 2.5 Mbps | 2.5 Mbps | Bidirectional | Microsoft Teams HD video call |

- **SSL/TLS Encryption**: All connections encrypted with modern TLS
- **Certificate Management**: Automatic Let's Encrypt renewal
- **CORS Policy**: Configurable cross-origin resource sharing

### Process Security

- **Process Isolation**: Each user type runs in separate process space
- **Resource Limits**: Automatic cleanup prevents resource exhaustion
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous process health validation
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms for process failures

## Single User Mode Resource Management

### Current Implementation Status: **PHASE 1 COMPLETE** âœ…

The Single User Mode has been enhanced with Phase 1 critical fixes to prevent resource leaks and ensure proper stream cleanup after test completion.

#### Phase 1 Implementation Complete

**âœ… Enhanced Test Completion Cleanup**
- [`client/app.js`](client/app.js:handleTestComplete) - Mandatory stream termination on test complete
- Comprehensive verification that all streams are properly terminated
- Fallback to emergency cleanup if graceful termination fails

**âœ… Emergency Cleanup Mechanism**
- [`client/streamManager.js`](client/streamManager.js:emergencyCleanup) - Force termination when graceful cleanup fails
- Immediate abort of all stream controllers and readers
- Complete registry cleanup with event dispatching

**âœ… Enhanced Stream Termination**
- [`client/streamManager.js`](client/streamManager.js:terminateAllStreams) - Timeout and verification for all streams
- [`client/streamManager.js`](client/streamManager.js:terminateStream) - Improved individual stream termination
- Timeout mechanisms to prevent hanging cleanup operations
- Enhanced error handling and logging

**âœ… Testing Infrastructure**
- [`client/test_phase1_cleanup.html`](client/test_phase1_cleanup.html) - Comprehensive test interface for verifying Phase 1 implementation

#### Planned Future Enhancements

- **Automatic Session Timeout**: 5-minute maximum duration with 2-minute inactivity timeout (Phase 2)
- **Periodic Health Checks**: 15-second interval monitoring for orphaned streams (Phase 3)
- **Activity Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of stream activity and lifecycle (Phase 2)

#### Stream Lifecycle Management

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Test Start] --> B[Create Streams]
    B --> C[Health Monitor Active]
    C --> D[Stream Activity Tracking]
    D --> E{Test Complete?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Mandatory Termination]
    E -->|No| G{Timeout Reached?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Force Cleanup]
    G -->|No| D
    F --> I[Verify Cleanup]
    H --> I
    I --> J{Streams Remaining?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Emergency Cleanup]
    J -->|No| L[Test Complete]
    K --> L
```

#### Cleanup Mechanisms

1. **Test Completion Cleanup**: Immediate termination of all streams when test ends
2. **Timeout-Based Cleanup**: Automatic termination after maximum duration
3. **Health Check Cleanup**: Periodic detection and cleanup of orphaned streams
4. **Emergency Cleanup**: Force termination with extreme prejudice when other methods fail
5. **Page Unload Cleanup**: Browser navigation and tab close handling

#### Implementation Details

- **Stream Registry**: Centralized tracking of all active streams with metadata
- **AbortController Integration**: Proper fetch request cancellation
- **Reader Cancellation**: Explicit stream reader termination
- **Activity Timestamps**: Real-time tracking of last stream activity
- **Timeout Monitoring**: Per-stream timeout enforcement with warnings
